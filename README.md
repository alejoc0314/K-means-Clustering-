# K-Means Clustering Algorithm in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python, a popular unsupervised learning technique used to group data into clusters. By implementing K-Means, we can identify patterns and segment data based on their similarity.

## What is K-Means?
K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the positions of cluster centroids until it converges to a solution.

## Project Steps
Import Libraries:

numpy for generating sample data.
sklearn for implementing the K-Means algorithm.
matplotlib for visualizing the clustering results.
Generate Sample Data:

### Created a synthetic dataset with random values in a 2D plane.
Apply K-Means Algorithm:

### Created a K-Means instance with a specified number of clusters.
Fitted the model to the sample data to compute cluster centroids and labels.
Visualization:

Plotted the clusters and centroids using matplotlib, with different colors for each cluster and markers for the centroids.
